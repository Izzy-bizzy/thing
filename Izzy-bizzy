    <h3 id="hey">Hey, it's Izzy!</h3>
<p>So this week's coding assignment is to write a blog about what we've learned so far, and also to create a business idea.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So far I've learned:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4 id="js">JavaScript:</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li>Making shapes (e.g. ellipses, rects, etc.)</li>
<li>Changing color</li>
<li>Animation with code</li>
<li>Coding variables</li>
<li>Mouse interaction</li>
<li>Inserting text into a JS page</li>
<li>And more :D</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4 id="html">HTML:</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li>Text editing (e.g. emphasis)</li>
<li>Lists (like I'm using right now! Bullet and number lists are a piece of cake.)</li>
<li>Inserting images into an HTML page</li>
<li>How to create tables</li>
<li>How to create <a href="#internal-links">internal</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://moz.com/learn/seo/external-link">external</a> links</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4 id="css">CSS:</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li>Selecting by id's and classes (id's are used to, for example, change the color of a heading (like I did with the CSS header above) by a unique title (like "#css"), and classes are pretty much the same except you can use the same one for multiple things, unlike id's. I hope that made sense..)</li>
<li>How to write and edit text (e.g. color, font, etc.)</li>
<li>How to change the color of various aspects of an HTML page (e.g. background color, text color, paragraph color, etc.)</li>
<li>And a LOT more (with more to learn :D)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<br>
<div id="internal-links">
<h3>Internal Links</h3>
<p>Internal links are links that connect to text that you can click, and when you do it takes you to wherever the code specifies on the page.</p></div>
<h4></h4>
<br>
<p></p>
<p>Needless to say, I've learned a lot. But programmers never stop learning! There's always something new that you didn't know before, and it's the same with almost anything you do.</p>
<br>
<div id="idea">
<h4>Business (kind of) Idea</h4>
<!-- this is hard help -->
<p>Art is a source of inspiration, more for some, less for others. It's also a a way to raise awareness to world problems, such as animal cruelty, animal and plant extinction, and pollution, as well as many other things. My business idea is to bring together a collection of artists from around the world to create art from all different mediums to sell and raise revenue to donate to charities and causes, as well as accept donations from the general public to donate.</div>
