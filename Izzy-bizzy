# Blog
<h3>Hey, it's Izzy!</h3>
<p>So this week's coding assignment is to write a blog about what we've learned so far, and also to create a business idea.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So far I've learned:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>JavaScript:</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li>Making shapes (e.g. ellipses, rects, etc.)</li>
<li>Changing color</li>
<li>Animation with code</li>
<li>Coding variables</li>
<li>Mouse interaction</li>
<li>Inserting text into a JS doc</li>
<li>And more :D</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>HTML:</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li>Text editing (e.g. emphasis)</li>
<li>Lists (like I'm using right now! Bullet and number lists are a piece of cake.)</li>
<li>Inserting images into an HTML page</li>
<li>How to create tables</li>
<li>How to create internal and external linksÂ </li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<h3>Internal Links</h3>
<div id="internal-links" style="position: absolute; margin: -50px;"></div>
<p>Internal links are links that connect to text that you can click, and when you do it takes you to wherever the code specifics on the page. That's how the arrow on the bottom-right of your screen works!</p>
<h4></h4>
<h3>External Links</h3>
<p>External links are links connected to text that you can click, and when you do it takes you to another website! (usually)</p>
<p></p>
<ul></ul>
<ol></ol>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>CSS:</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li>Selecting by id's and classes ()</li>
<li>How to write and edit text (e.g. color, font, etc.)</li>
<li>How to change the color of various aspects of an HTML page (e.g. background color, text color, paragraph color, etc.)</li>
<li>And a LOT more (with more to learn :D)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p>Needless to say, I've learned a lot. But programmers never stop learning! There's always something new that you didn't know before, and it's the same with almost anything you do.</p>
